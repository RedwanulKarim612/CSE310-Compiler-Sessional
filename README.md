# CSE310-Compiler-Sessional
This repository contains the assignments from the CSE310-Compiler course. The main objective of these assignments is to create a compiler that converts a subset of C language into 8086 assembly code.


## Offline 1
Construct a **symbol table** to store type and scope information of a symbol in the source program.

## Offline 2
Perform **lexical analysis** and convert the source program into a sequence of tokens.

## Offline 3
Perform **syntax and semantic analysis** on the sequence of tokens produced by the lexer. Make sure the source program follows the given grammar. Check for syntax and semantic errors.

## Offline 4
**Generate intermediate code** for the source program. Convert the source program into 8086 assmenly code.
